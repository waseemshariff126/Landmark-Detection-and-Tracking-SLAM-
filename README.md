# Landmark-Detection-and-Tracking-SLAM-
In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! Youâ€™ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.

Project Instructions
The project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures. 

Notebook 1 : Robot Moving and Sensing

Notebook 2 : Omega and Xi, Constraints

Notebook 3 : Landmark Detection and Tracking

Apart from these there is class called robot.py in which we observed all the movements of robot (move, sense, make landmarks and etc)
